I'm using Ubuntu, so I'm not sure if these directories are the same (they should be though... or at least most of them)

Make sure to set these environment variables when you use OSG:
(This took me forever to find out, the stupid OSG docs didn't mention the last variable!)

1.) PATH=:/home/name/Documents/Research/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.1
2.) LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/home/name/Documents/Research/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph-3.2.1/lib
3.) OSG_FILE_PATH=/home/name/Documents/Research/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph-Data:/home/name/Documents/Research/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph-Data/Images
